# G-Repo

G-Repo is a tool developed in java and it is useful in the **Mining Software Repository**, this area aims to collect empirical evidence using the data available in software repositories present on github.

For example:

* “When and Why Your Code Starts to Smell Bad (and Whether the Smells
Go Away)”
* “Do Developers Feel Emotions? An Exploratory Analysis of Emotions in
         Software Artifacts”

Many **MSR** studies use GitHub as a data source because:

* It contains millions of open source repositories.
* Provides a REST API to extract this data.

But which repositories to identify to conduct an **MSR** study?

* A trend is to select a number of top starred repositories, which are the most voted repositories by GitHub users.
